        <p>Dear Dad,</p>
        <p>
          Happy Birthday Dad! Even though I can't celebrate with you, I want you to know how much I truly love 
          and appreciate you. You are one of the most kind, loving, generous, fun, and determined people I have ever known.
          I thank God everyday that I was blessed with an amazing father like you and look up to you. You
          are a a great person who deserves a great day today. Nakupenda sana!! 
        </p>
        <p>Love, Linda</p>
